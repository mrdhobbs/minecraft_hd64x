<h1>Description</h1>
This texture pack is a 64x rendition of the Vanilla textures. Wait! There more! I have also added some subtle 3D textures, and some custom rain sounds!

This is a resource pack that is a more detailed version of its original counterpart (the default vanilla textures that are in the game). With that said, the textures may look similar to other faithful texture packs - this is because we are all basing ours off the same thing. So before you accuse me of copying or anything of a similar matter, please do your research.

<h1>Fan Update</h1>

Originally developed by shadowtime1290, mrdhobbs took over maintenance of this pack in March 2016, with a version for Minecraft 1.9.

The pack is 100% complete (as of Minecraft 1.21.4). I do not add textures for the snapshot versions, as they often change before final release. Once the release is close, I then start working on the new textures.
